# Polyhedra Explorer

**ðŸš§ Work in process.**
                                              
## Building & running

```shell
gradlew jsBrowserDevelopmentRun 
```

## Roadmap / TODO
                       
* Animations
  * [x] Animate all param changes
  * [x] Animate polyhedra transformations
  * [ ] Animate topology-preserving transitions (e.g. canonicalization)
  * [ ] Animate multi-step transformations
* Asynchrony 
  * [x] Move canonicalization algo to a WebWorker
  * [ ] Better progress bar display
* Export 
  * [ ] Solid to STL
  * [x] Geometry to OpenSCAD  
* Polyhedra
  * [ ] Bigger library of seeds
      * [x] Platonic solids
      * [x] Arhimedean solids
      * [ ] Catalan solids
      * [ ] Johnson solids
  * [ ] Identify names of well-know polyhedra
* Rendering
  * [ ] Render nicer edges and vertices
  * [ ] Render better-looking (physical) materials 
  * [ ] Color faces by geometry
