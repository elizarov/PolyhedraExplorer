# Polyhedra Explorer

**ðŸš§ Work in process.**

Interactive polyhedra explorer with animated transformations. This project is focused on regular convex 
polyhedra and derivation of larger polyhedra via 
[Conway polyhedron notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway_polyhedron_notation).
All transformations are symmetry-preserving and all resulting elements (faces, edges, vertices) 
are grouped into rotation orbits and are colored by default with respect to them.  

Prototype is deployed at [http://polyhedron.me](http://polyhedron.me)
                                              
## Building & running

```shell
gradlew jsBrowserDevelopmentRun 
```
